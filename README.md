# Network Reconnaissance Scripts & Techniques

This repository documents a series of hands-on exercises in network reconnaissance and analysis. It contains a collection of scripts and command-line techniques for network discovery and service enumeration, including examples of using tools like `nmap`, `grep`, and `tcpdump` to perform host discovery, identify services, and analyze network protocol behavior.

All work was performed in a sandboxed virtual environment against test machines like Metasploitable.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
*   **Live Host Discovery:** Identifying active machines on a network.
*   **Service Enumeration:** Discovering open ports and identifying running software versions.
*   **Network Protocol Analysis:** Differentiating between TCP and UDP scan behaviors.
*   **Command-Line Fu:** Proficient use of `nmap`, `grep`, `cut`, and `tcpdump` for targeted data extraction and analysis.

## Live Host Discovery

### Objective
To efficiently identify all active hosts on a given subnet that respond to a ping request.

### Method
I constructed a bash one-liner that chains several commands together:
1.  `nmap -sn`: Performs a fast, "no-ports" ping scan to find live hosts.
2.  `grep`: Filters the output to isolate lines that contain host IP addresses.
3.  `cut`: Parses the filtered lines to extract only the IP address field.
4.  The final, clean list of IPs is redirected into a file named `live-hosts.lst`.

### Command
```bash
nmap -sn <target-subnet> | grep 'Nmap scan' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 > live-hosts.lst
```

# Service and Version Enumeration
### Objective
To scan a target machine, identify all open ports, and determine the specific software and version running on each port.

### Method
nmap with the -sV flag, which enables version detection. This powerful feature probes each open port to gather service banners and analyze responses, providing detailed insights that are crucial for vulnerability identification and management.

### Command

```bash
nmap -sV <target-ip>
```

### Output
The scan produces a detailed list of open ports, the service name, and the specific version of the software running. An example of the output from a scan against a Metasploitable machine has been uploaded to this repository.
(See nmap-version-scan.png for the full output.)

# TCP vs. UDP Scan Analysis

### Objective
To analyze and document the differences in network traffic generated by TCP and UDP port scans.

### Method
Ran two separate nmap scans against the same set of ports (21, 53, 80, 1999) on a target machine: one default TCP scan and one UDP scan (-sU). I monitored both scans using tcpdump to capture the underlying network packets and observe the different behaviors.

### Findings
Analysis of the packet captures confirmed the following:
*   **TCP Scans (Stateful): The capture clearly showed the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for open ports. For closed ports, the target responded with a RST (Reset) packet. This makes TCP scans highly reliable.
*   **UDP Scans (Stateless): The capture showed that for closed ports, the target machine correctly responded with ICMP "Port Unreachable" messages. For open ports, there was simply no response. This highlights a key defensive consideration: if a firewall blocks outgoing ICMP traffic, a UDP scan will incorrectly label all ports as open|filtered, making the scan results unreliable and noisy.

### Output
The nmap output from both scans is included in this repository, clearly showing the different results for the same set of ports.
(See tcp-udp-scan-results.png for the nmap output.)
